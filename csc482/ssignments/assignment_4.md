## Assignment 4
### Due: October 7, 2020


For this assignment you will need to create a ***module***. The name of the ***module*** should be ***yourName_calculator***. As the name suggests, the module will have functions that implement some of the basic functions of a calculator - *add, subtract, division, multiplication, logarithm*.

Your outputs must match the following:

```Python
print(yourName_calculator.add(1,2))  # output: 3
print(yourName_calculator.multiply(2,3)) # output: 6
print(yourName_calculator.div(1,0)) # output: Can't divide by zero!
print(yourName_calculator.subtract(100,99)) # output: 1
print(yourName_calculator.div(6,3)) # output: 2.0
print(yourName_calculator.logarithm(100,10)) # output: 2.0
print(yourName_calculator.logarithm(256,2)) # output: 8.0
```

Please note that the text that starts with **#** indicates a comment. The comment tells you the output you would see after you have run the code. The comment is not part of the actual code. Make sure to replace *yourName* with your name. If your name is Mark, the name of the module should be mark_calculator.

You will submit a total of three files within a zipped folder. 

1. The *yourName_calculator.py* fiile.
2. The *main.py* file where you implement the code as shown above.
3. A screenshot showing the outputs.

The zipped folder should be named **yourName_assignment_4.zip** .

Please note that, it is important you submit the zipped folder properly. A zipped folder or files submitted incorrectly will not be graded. Please ask during classtime if you have any question about the format, or how to create a zipped folder.
