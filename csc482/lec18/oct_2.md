### Problem 1

Write code in Python that prints at least two lines to a text file. Name the file "hello.txt." Each line must contain at least two different numbers and two different English words.

Then write a function that takes the filename as a parameter. The function should read data from the given filename. As the function reads data, it should put any number it finds in a separate list. Finally, the function should return the list to the program that is calling it.

Also, write code to test that function, and pass "hello.txt" as an argument.
