notes from courses I am teaching

If you are interested in learning Python, there are a lot of Jupyter Notebooks, that you can download and play with. 

I also discuss a bit complex concepts like decorators, generators etc. with very easy to understand examples.

Obviously, the accompanying video lectures are missing. However, the notebooks can very well be sufficient if you play with them.
